## Appendix: Open Questions

### How should I insulate the wheel wells?

Use leftover polyiso to build enclosures

### Should I apply some kind of undercoating?

Nah. Factory rustproofing should be fine. I'll check behind the panels now and again.

### Should I use a separate sound deadening material?

Maybe eventually. We can figure this out later.

### What kind of adhesive should I use?

Do not use spray foam.

Ideally it'd seal out water in large irregular spaces

VELCRO!

### How should I hold in the soft insulation?

Use plastic sheet for now but let it sit directly beneath wall panels later.

### Should I insulate the floor at all?

Yes

### Should I use spray foam or sheepswool in the nooks and crannies?

Do not use spray foam.

### Should I use XPS instead of Polyiso because of the time I'll spend in cold temperatures?

Doesn't really matter.

### What kind of insulation & adhesion should I use for the...

#### floor ?

1/4" XPS

#### ceiling & walls?

Polyiso
Attach with magnets or 3M™ Hi-Strength 90 Spray Adhesive or ??

#### nooks and crannies?

Sheepswool OR foam OR thinsulate OR polyfill OR polyester fill

### [The Vanual](http://thevanual.com)

http://thevanual.com/insulation

 - They glue reflectix to walls and ceiling
 - They put rigid foam (DOW Super TUFF-R) into the walls and ceiling, held in place by tension (but taped with Tyvek for good measure.
 - They filled gaps with "great stuff gaps and cracks" spray foam
 - They make a rose paper floor template
 - They filled other gaps with fiberglass insulation

### [Gnomad Home](https://gnomadhome.com)

https://gnomadhome.com/van-build-insulation/

 - Excellent guide on theory
 - They recommend adding "Noico’s sound deadening mat" under the insulation
 - They use lumber to hold panels in place while the adhesive sets

> HERE'S HOW WE RECOMMEND INSULATING YOUR VAN IN MOST CASES:
> **Walls**: Use ¾” to 1” polyiso foam board, glued to the van body using Great Stuff spray foam or 3M High Strength 90 spray adhesive. Fill any gaps with spray foam.
> **Ceiling**: Use 1” to 2” polyiso foam board, glued to the ceiling using Great Stuff spray foam or 3M High Strength 90 spray adhesive. Fill any gaps with spray foam.
> **Floor**: This is less important. Use ½” XPS foam board or none. Another option is Reflectix, which will provide at least some sort of thermal break without taking up too much height.
> **Windows**: Reversible window coverings with a radiant barrier on one side (like Reflectix, Insul-Shine, or EZ-Cool). Face the radiant barrier outwards on hot days to reflect heat away from the van. Face it inwards during cold weather to retain heat inside the van.
> **Ventilation**: We always recommend installing a vent fan. Combined with proper insulation, a vent fan can both keep your van cool and help you deal with moisture and condensation.

### [FarOutRide](http://faroutride.com)

 - They use thinsulate, 3M 90 spray adhesive, Low-E EZ-Cool and are very happy with the results

### [Orton Transit Van](http://www.ortontransit.info)

 - filled low portions of corrugated floor with 1/2" closed cell foam
 - removed OEM D Rings and attached plywood floor to the leftover bolt holes
 - used 1" - 1 1/2" thick polyisocyanurate on floor & roof
 - used "Great Stuff" on gaps & cracks and edges
 - used Aerocel closed cell foam and Aeroseal contact adhesive

### [Build A Green RV](http://www.buildagreenrv.com)

![](http://www.buildagreenrv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DBHeatLossPlot1.jpg)

Recommends avoiding Polystyrene including EPS and XPS because it can melt at 165F

### [Moreys in Transit](http://moreysintransit.com)

 - Use thinsulate & 3M 90 Spray Adhesive

### [Vandwellers Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers)

https://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers/comments/60nqwe/magnets_are_your_friend_how_ive_used_magnets_so/

Attach insulation panels using disc magnets & HVAC tape

https://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers/comments/6l5k5x/what_not_to_do_a_warning_about_foil_insulation/

Foil insulation is flammable!

### [Ford Transit USA Forum](http://www.fordtransitusaforum.com)
<!-- Do a general Google Search -->

### https://www.parkedinparadise.com/insulate-van/

3M 90 spray adhesive won't seal out water, spray foam will

### http://www.90000milestome.com/01/insulation-considerations/

Recommend foamular solid foam board
Point to aerogel seller: http://www.buyaerogel.com/product/spaceloft-10-mm-cut-to-size
Suggest foam offgassing is pretty toxic
Suggest checking online for insulation scraps left over from bigger project

### Sprinter RV Conversion Book

Recommends a base layer of acoustic sound deadening material or [rubber undercoat](
https://www.amazon.com/3M-Rubberized-Undercoating-08883-19-7/dp/B00MK91J1I/ref=as_at?imprToken=fbx6fj0cwVNAOhGFVb2gLA&slotNum=7&SubscriptionId=0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82&tag=kayal-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00MK91J1I) to prevent rust

Suggests Polyester batts are a good insulating material (two major brands discontinued, some intended for quilting available on Amazon: [Polyester Batting](https://www.amazon.com/Polyester-Batting-Medium-Yard-Double-Rolled/dp/B002762F0S/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1521151023&sr=8-4&keywords=polyester+insulation&dpID=31LGun9QYjL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch), [Dream Puff](https://www.amazon.com/Quilters-Dream-Batting-122in-120in/dp/B00NB7NIPI/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1521151023&sr=8-7&keywords=polyester+insulation&dpID=41AVZxCaTSL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch), [Polyfill](https://www.amazon.com/Fairfield-PF12A-Poly-Fil-Polyester-12-Ounce/dp/B000YZ7G44)

Suggests cotton batts can work if there's a layer between the metal and the insulation.
