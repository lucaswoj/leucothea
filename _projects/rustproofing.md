## Appendix: Open Questions

### Should I use an auto paint repair kit instead?

Maybe. I'll ask at the hardware store.

### Where can I put it while it dries?

A trailhead or hardware store parking lot.

### How long will it take to dry?

Let's say 2-3 hours until I can lock up the van.

### Should I use spray-on or paint-on rustproofing?

Paint-on is preferable but I'll take whatever's in stock.

### Should I use primer + enamel or a standalone rust inhibitor?

Standalone rust inhibitor only works on bare metal. I need primer + enamel.

### Should I paint all surfaces or just the floor?

Just the floor & any noticeable scuffs.

### Do I need to rustproof the inside at all?
Not really...

### What brand of rustproofing should I use?
Rust-oleum is the most popular, most trusted, and easy to find in stores.

### Should I use a zinc metal primer?
No, requires unpainted surface.

> 7 Spray anti-rust paint on any exposed metal

> First, tape anything you don’t want painted white using painter’s tape. This includes weather stripping, latches and door panels.
>
> There’s multiple brands of rust-conversion paint. Some comes in a spray can. The really heavy duty stuff comes in a two part mixture you brush on. Use the one of your choosing to paint over any exposed metal that you grinded.
>
> While it’s debatable whether this step is really necessary, it seems like a reasonable precaution to take. Rust is no joke.

> Our last step was to protect the neutralized rust. Brunox epoxy serves simultaneously as a rust neutralizer and a primer, so we did not have to use a primer separately. After the rust neutralizer had dried completely, which took quite a while due to the lower temperatures we’re currently experiencing, we painted over it with metal paint. This will protect the newly formed chemical compound from water and air and reduces the chances for rust to return.
