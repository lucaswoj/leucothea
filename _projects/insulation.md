### [The Vanual](http://thevanual.com)

http://thevanual.com/insulation

 - They glue reflectix to walls and ceiling
 - They put rigid foam (DOW Super TUFF-R) into the walls and ceiling, held in place by tension (but taped with Tyvek for good measure.
 - They filled gaps with "great stuff gaps and cracks" spray foam
 - They make a rose paper floor template
 - They filled other gaps with fiberglass insulation

### [Gnomad Home](https://gnomadhome.com)

https://gnomadhome.com/van-build-insulation/

 - Excellent guide on theory
 - They recommend adding "Noico’s sound deadening mat" under the insulation
 - They use lumber to hold panels in place while the adhesive sets

> HERE'S HOW WE RECOMMEND INSULATING YOUR VAN IN MOST CASES:
> **Walls**: Use ¾” to 1” polyiso foam board, glued to the van body using Great Stuff spray foam or 3M High Strength 90 spray adhesive. Fill any gaps with spray foam.
> **Ceiling**: Use 1” to 2” polyiso foam board, glued to the ceiling using Great Stuff spray foam or 3M High Strength 90 spray adhesive. Fill any gaps with spray foam.
> **Floor**: This is less important. Use ½” XPS foam board or none. Another option is Reflectix, which will provide at least some sort of thermal break without taking up too much height.
> **Windows**: Reversible window coverings with a radiant barrier on one side (like Reflectix, Insul-Shine, or EZ-Cool). Face the radiant barrier outwards on hot days to reflect heat away from the van. Face it inwards during cold weather to retain heat inside the van.
> **Ventilation**: We always recommend installing a vent fan. Combined with proper insulation, a vent fan can both keep your van cool and help you deal with moisture and condensation.

### [FarOutRide](http://faroutride.com)

 - They use thinsulate, 3M 90 spray adhesive, Low-E EZ-Cool and are very happy with the results

### [Orton Transit Van](http://www.ortontransit.info)

 - filled low portions of corrugated floor with 1/2" closed cell foam
 - removed OEM D Rings and attached plywood floor to the leftover bolt holes
 - used 1" - 1 1/2" thick polyisocyanurate on floor & roof
 - used "Great Stuff" on gaps & cracks and edges
 - used Aerocel closed cell foam and Aeroseal contact adhesive

### [Build A Green RV](http://www.buildagreenrv.com)

![](http://www.buildagreenrv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DBHeatLossPlot1.jpg)

Recommends avoiding Polystyrene including EPS and XPS because it can melt at 165F

### [Moreys in Transit](http://moreysintransit.com)

 - Use thinsulate & 3M 90 Spray Adhesive

Attach insulation panels using disc magnets & HVAC tape

https://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers/comments/6l5k5x/what_not_to_do_a_warning_about_foil_insulation/

Foil insulation is flammable!

### [Ford Transit USA Forum](http://www.fordtransitusaforum.com)
<!-- Do a general Google Search -->

### https://www.parkedinparadise.com/insulate-van/

3M 90 spray adhesive won't seal out water, spray foam will

### http://www.90000milestome.com/01/insulation-considerations/

Recommend foamular solid foam board
Point to aerogel seller: http://www.buyaerogel.com/product/spaceloft-10-mm-cut-to-size
Suggest foam offgassing is pretty toxic
Suggest checking online for insulation scraps left over from bigger project

## Appendix B: Open Questions

### Should I use a separate sound deadening material?

### Should I insulate the floor at all?

### What kind of adhesive should I use? Spray foam or 3M High Strength 90?

Spray foam is the only way to ensure no water gets in.  

### Should I use spray foam or sheepswool in the nooks and crannies?

?

### Should I use XPS instead of Polyiso because of the time I'll spend in cold temperatures?

Doesn't really matter.

### What kind of insulation & adhesion should I use for the...

#### floor ?

thinnest XPS

#### ceiling & walls?

Polyiso or XPS

#### nooks and crannies?

Sheepswool OR foam OR thinsulate
